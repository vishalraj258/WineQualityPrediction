# WineQualityPrediction
This is a machine learning model which predicts the quality of wine. The dataset has 11 features and 1599 records. The wine quality had 6 different types. I divided wine quality into 3 different categories poor, average and good. It is a multi class classification problem. I used logostic regression(multi class), decision tree and random forest to solve this problem.
